# some summary about what you do
summary:
  - I am a software architect focused on backend.
  - I have experience in Microservices architectures developed in Java (Spring Framework - Boot, Cloud), Kotlin and kafka (async).
  - I am always very focused on looking for open-source / infrastructure level solutions (Camunda for orchestration or OPA to handle authorization policies) rather than custom implementations.
  - Any infrastructure level solution is usually better than a custom implementation.
  - Remember !! People is first than processes !!
